## Setting Up the Gemini API Key for `myAIs`

The `myAIs` app requires an API key from the Gemini API to function correctly. This key is managed securely using the `secrets-gradle-plugin`. If the `secrets/apiKey.properties` file is not present, the project will use fallback values provided in the `default.properties` file.

### Steps to Set Up the Gemini API Key

1. **Ensure the `default.properties` File is Configured**:
    - In the root directory of the project, ensure there is a `default.properties` file. This file provides default values, including a placeholder for the Gemini API key.

   Example `default.properties`:
   ```properties
   GEMINI_API_KEY=*********************************
   GEMINI_BASE_URL="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/"
   DRIVE_BASE_URL="https://www.googleapis.com/"
   PROMPT_BASE_URL="http://localhost/"
   ```
    - The placeholder value `*********************************` will be used during the build process if no real key is provided.

### Important Notes

- **Do Not Modify Base URLs**: The base URLs for services used by the application are defined in `default.properties`. To maintain consistent functionality, avoid modifying these URLs.
- **Security**: Ensure that any files containing API keys, like `apiKey.properties`, are excluded from version control to keep your keys secure.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the `myAIs` project builds successfully in all environments.
